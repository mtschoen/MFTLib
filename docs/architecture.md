# Architecture contracts

- **MFTLibNative** (C++ DLL) - Core NTFS MFT parsing logic with multi-threaded parallel fixup+parse and double-buffered I/O. Fully thread-safe and re-entrant. MFT record geometry (1024 or 4096-byte records) is detected at runtime rather than assumed - `FSCTL_GET_NTFS_VOLUME_DATA` for a live volume, record 0's header for an exported file. Results cross the P/Invoke boundary through compact ABI version 3 (`MFT_NATIVE_ABI_VERSION`): 50-byte `MftCompactEntry` rows with int64 size at offset 32, int64 modified time (FILETIME) at offset 40, and uint16 sequence number at offset 48, plus separate UTF-16 string pools. Flags bit `0x8000` marks an unknown size; `0x4000` marks an unresolved path whose path-table string is a bare name (path table only). The broker's block path parses without path resolution.
- **MFTLib** (C# Library) - Managed wrapper with P/Invoke interop. The `MFTLib.Index` namespace provides a substrate-neutral columnar block format and query engine; see `docs/index-format.md`.
    - **Index namespace boundary**: `MFTLib.Index` depends on nothing in the flat `MFTLib` namespace or in `MFTLib.Interop` beyond an allowlist of journal value types (`UsnJournalEntry`, `UsnJournalEntryOptions`, `UsnReason`). Enforced by `MFTLib.Tests/Index/NamespaceBoundaryTests.cs`, an IL-level ArchUnitNET test over the built assembly, with a mandatory negative-control fixture. Not an aislop rule: the forbidden folders share the flat `MFTLib` namespace, so there is no `using` for an import rule to match. Growing the allowlist is a review decision.
    - **Consumer cache identity**: `FileIndexOptions.CacheTag` carries an opaque
      four-ASCII-character code plus a `uint` version; default is all zeros and
      compares exactly, not as a wildcard. Block format 3 stores the two values
      at offsets 104 and 108 in a 112-byte declared header. Old-format blocks
      cold-scan once. Consumers bump their own version when their profile or
      keep-list changes. Mismatches report `WrongCacheTag` and cold-scan; a
      cache-only open fails with `DriveFailureKind.CacheTagMismatch`. Both emit
      stored/requested tag diagnostics. `InspectCached` reports tags on available
      blocks. Tags are initialized before completion; custom MFT producers copy
      `request.CacheTag` into creation options, and the built-in broker adapter
      forwards it automatically. See `docs/index-format.md` for the contract.

    - **ABI versioning**: `MFTLibNative.EnsureCompatibleNativeAbi()` / `MftResult`'s constructor check the native ABI version and entry stride before parsing, and throw `InvalidOperationException` immediately on a managed/native mismatch instead of decoding mismatched memory.

    - **Watch state events**: `FileIndex.WatchStateChanged` reports every change of a drive's
      derived `WatchCatchUp` with a per-drive `WatchStateVersion`, noted by one helper inside the
      state-lock section that made the change and delivered with neither `_stateLock` nor a write
      gate held, one drive at a time in version order, before the `WatchFaulted` of the fault
      that caused it. Handlers follow the `Changed`/`WatchFaulted` reentrancy rules. The full
      contract is in `docs/watch-lifetime.md`.
    - **Lazy Materialization**: `MftRecord` stores native pointers; strings are only created on access.
    - **Memory Safety**: `ToArray()` and `Materialize()` ensure strings are stable in managed memory after native buffers are freed.
    - **Streaming API**: `StreamRecords` provides memory-efficient `IEnumerable<MftRecord>`; `MaterializeBatches`/`ReadRecordBatches` provide bounded-memory batch materialization over the same result.
    - **ElevationUtilities**: Shared logic for detecting and ensuring Administrative privileges.

- **TestProgram** (C# Console App) - CLI that reads MFT metadata for specified drives. Automatically self-elevates.
- **Benchmark** (C# Console App) - Performance benchmark using synthetic MFT generation.
- **MFTLib.Tests** (C# MSTest) - Unit tests for record mapping and path resolution.
- **MFTLibTestExtensions** (C# Library) - Public, consumer-facing `BrokerTestHarness` that runs a
  `JournalBrokerHost` in process over in-memory control and drive pipes and returns an `InProcessBrokerHandle`
  holding the production `BrokerProcess` connected to it, with `Crash()` to simulate broker death. `BrokerTestHarnessOptions` supplies the client clock, per-pipe
  connection failures, and held host writes. Host faults surface only through production behavior:
  the `BrokerProcess.Ended` task, `BrokerChannelLostException` on pending operations, and
  `Error` frames; disposing the process never throws a host fault. Ships as the separate
  `MFTLib.TestExtensions` NuGet package at publish time; never folded into the `MFTLib` package.

### Native error messages

Native exports write failure reasons into fixed-size `wchar_t errorMessage[256]` buffers on their result structs (`MftParseResult`, `UsnJournalInfo`, `UsnJournalResult`). Use the `SetErrorMessage` helper in `MFTLibNative/internal.h` - a variadic template that deduces buffer size, truncates via `_snwprintf_s(..., _TRUNCATE, ...)` on Windows or `std::swprintf` with explicit NUL termination on POSIX, and asserts in debug builds if a message doesn't fit. Avoid calling `swprintf_s` / `snprintf_s` directly at error-write sites; the helper keeps `cert-err33-c` silent and centralizes the truncation semantic.

### Native test hooks ship in the release DLL

`MFTLibNative/core/test_hooks.cpp` exports failure-injection and observation hooks
(`SetAllocFailCountdown`, `SetReadFailCountdown`, `SetUsnIoFailError`, `SetUsnWatchPipe`,
`GetChunkThreadCounts`, `ResetTestState` and the rest). They are compiled into the Release
`MFTLibNative.dll` that the NuGet package ships, deliberately. The exports are test-only and
unsupported: they are not part of the managed public API, and they may change or disappear in
any release.

Why they stay:

- The shipped DLL must be the tested DLL. Coverage and CI exercise the exact binary in the
  package, failure paths included. Compiling the hooks out for the package would mean tests run
  against a different binary than consumers get, and would add a second native build
  configuration to the vcxproj, CMake, the coverage scripts and CI.
- The checks cannot live anywhere else. They sit in front of allocations and reads inside the
  parser and journal code, so a managed package such as `MFTLibTestExtensions` cannot provide
  them. `MFTLibTestExtensions` does not use them.
- They are not a privilege boundary. Only code already loaded in the same process can call the
  exports, and such code can already do worse.
- The cost was measured and is not significant. On 2026-10-02, at commit `d8439ab`, the Release
  DLL was built twice with the same settings: as shipped, and with every parse-path hook
  compiled to a constant (allocation, read and platform I/O failure, forced cancel, the
  capacity and record-size overrides, and the per-chunk thread-count recording with its mutex).
  `Benchmark.exe 1000000 5` ran eight times against each DLL, alternating. Median throughput
  in records per second, with hooks and without: compat 3,243,295 and 3,312,850; bounded
  3,374,366 and 3,451,267; broker-stream 2,408,314 and 2,410,359. The same DLL varied by 10 to
  25 percent between runs on a machine that was also running builds, so the gap of about 2
  percent is inside the noise; the best runs were equal (bounded 3,583,085 and 3,584,190).
  The benchmark is bound by I/O and memory throughput, not by parser overhead. The hook-free
  DLL was 2,048 bytes smaller (75,776 against 77,824).

Revisit this only with a measurement that shows a cost: a quiet-machine benchmark where the
hook-free build wins by more than the run-to-run spread. Do not propose removing the hooks
from the shipping DLL on the grounds that test code is present in a release binary.
